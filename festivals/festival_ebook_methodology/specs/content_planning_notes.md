# Content Planning Notes

## Key Messages to Convey

### Primary Messages
1. **Flexibility is a Feature**: Rigid processes kill creativity and momentum
2. **Goals Over Process**: Focus on what you're building, not how you're tracking it
3. **Scale Without Ceremony**: Works for solo devs and large teams alike
4. **Practical Over Theoretical**: Real examples, real code, real results

### Supporting Messages
- You already know how to organize work, frameworks just get in the way
- Festivals adapt to your project, not vice versa
- Process should enable, not constrain
- Simplicity scales better than complexity

## Content Strategy

### Teaching Approach
1. **Show, Don't Tell**
   - Start with examples
   - Explain principles through practice
   - Theory follows application

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Simple festival first
   - Add complexity as needed
   - Always show escape hatches

3. **Problem-Solution Format**
   - Present common pain points
   - Show festival solution
   - Explain why it works

### Example Festival Ideas
1. **Bug Fix Festival** (Simple)
   - Single sequence, 2-3 tasks
   - Shows minimal overhead
   - 2-3 day completion

2. **Feature Addition** (Medium)
   - 3 sequences, parallel work
   - Shows dependency management
   - 1-2 week scope

3. **API Redesign** (Complex)
   - Multiple systems affected
   - Shows full structure
   - 1-2 month scope

4. **Startup MVP** (Adaptive)
   - Constant pivoting
   - Shows flexibility
   - 6-8 week journey

5. **Open Source Tool** (Collaborative)
   - Distributed team
   - Shows async coordination
   - Ongoing example

## Writing Principles

### Voice Guidelines
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Writing as an experienced dev to another dev
- **Pragmatic**: Acknowledge real-world messiness
- **Encouraging**: You can do this, it's not complicated
- **Honest**: Show failures and adaptations

### Style Elements
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Lots of subheadings for scanning
- Code/directory examples every 2-3 pages
- Sidebars for tips and warnings
- Chapter summaries with action items

## Chapter Flow Strategy

### Act 1: The Problem (Chapters 1-3)
- Hook with shared pain
- Validate reader's frustrations
- Introduce festival as natural solution

### Act 2: The Solution (Chapters 4-8)
- Build understanding progressively
- Lots of practical examples
- Reader can start using immediately

### Act 3: The Mastery (Chapters 9-12)
- Advanced scenarios
- Integration with existing processes
- Building festival culture

## Visual Content Plans

### Diagrams Needed
1. Festival structure overview
2. Sequential vs parallel work
3. Methodology comparison matrix
4. Scaling visualization
5. Before/after workflow

### Screenshots/Examples
1. Real festival directories
2. Actual FESTIVAL_OVERVIEW.md files
3. Task file examples
4. Git history showing adaptation
5. Team communication patterns
