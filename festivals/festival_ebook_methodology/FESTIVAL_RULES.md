# Festival Rules: Ebook on Festival Methodology

## Purpose
This document defines the writing standards, content principles, and quality guidelines that all contributors must follow throughout the ebook festival. Reference these rules before starting any task and during execution to ensure consistent, high-quality content.

## Content Excellence

### Writing Principles
- **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Use simple, direct language that readers can immediately understand
- **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Include practical examples, code snippets, and real scenarios
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Reader-Focused**: Always consider what the reader needs to know, not what you want to say

### Voice and Tone
- **Conversational but Professional**: Write as if explaining to a colleague
- **Empathetic**: Acknowledge reader frustrations with current methodologies
- **Encouraging**: Emphasize that Festival methodology is approachable and practical
- **Honest**: Show both successes and challenges in examples

### Content Structure
- Chapters should have clear learning objectives
- Use frequent subheadings for easy scanning (every 2-3 paragraphs)
- Include summaries at chapter ends with key takeaways
- Provide action items readers can implement immediately
- Balance theory with practical application (20/80 ratio)

## Quality Standards

### Accuracy Requirements
- [ ] All technical claims must be fact-checked
- [ ] Code examples must be tested and working
- [ ] File structures and commands must be accurate
- [ ] Comparisons with other methodologies must be fair and factual
- [ ] Statistics and data must include sources

### Consistency Checks
- [ ] Terminology used consistently throughout (see glossary)
- [ ] Examples follow the same naming conventions
- [ ] Festival structure representations are uniform
- [ ] Cross-references are accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Formatting follows established patterns

### Example Quality
- All examples must be realistic and practical
- Include both simple and complex scenarios
- Show complete context, not just fragments
- Test all code examples before inclusion
- Provide downloadable versions of templates

## Writing Process

### Before Writing
1. Review the chapter outline and objectives
2. Read related chapters for context and consistency
3. Check the writing style guide (docs/writing_style_guide.md)
4. Identify target reader persona for the section
5. Gather all necessary research and examples

### During Writing
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences ideal)
- Use active voice predominantly
- Include a practical example every 2-3 pages
- Add visual elements (diagrams, screenshots) where helpful
- Maintain consistent formatting

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Learning objectives clearly met
- [ ] Examples tested and working
- [ ] Terminology consistent with glossary
- [ ] Cross-references verified
- [ ] Tone appropriate for target audience
- [ ] No unexplained jargon
- [ ] Actionable takeaways included

## Content Standards

### Chapter Requirements
Each chapter must include:
- Brief summary (2-3 sentences)
- Learning objectives (3-5 bullet points)
- Introduction that hooks the reader
- Main content with clear progression
- Practical exercises or "Try This" sections
- Chapter summary with key points
- References to additional resources

### Visual Elements
- Diagrams should be simple and clear
- Use consistent visual style throughout
- Include captions for all figures
- Ensure accessibility (alt text, descriptions)
- File structures shown in tree format

### Code and Examples
```markdown
# Use this format for file structures
festivals/
└── festival_name/
    ├── FESTIVAL_OVERVIEW.md
    └── 1_sequence/
        └── task.md
```text

- Include comments in code examples
- Show both input and output where relevant
- Keep examples focused and minimal
- Use realistic project names and scenarios

## Terminology and Style

### Preferred Terms
- "Festival" not "project" or "sprint"
- "Festival planner" not "project manager"
- "Sequence" not "phase" or "stage"
- "Task" not "story" or "ticket"
- "Worker" not "developer" (when generic)
- "Goal" not "objective" or "outcome"

### Avoid
- Excessive exclamation points
- Condescending phrases ("simply", "just", "obviously")
- Overly technical jargon without explanation
- Absolute statements without evidence
- Criticizing other methodologies harshly

## Quality Gates

### Section Completion
Before marking any section complete:
- [ ] Content achieves stated objectives
- [ ] Examples are practical and tested
- [ ] Writing follows style guide
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified
- [ ] Consistency with other sections checked
- [ ] Reviewed by fresh eyes (if possible)

### Chapter Completion
Before marking chapter complete:
- [ ] All sections complete and reviewed
- [ ] Learning objectives demonstrably met
- [ ] Examples build on each other logically
- [ ] Smooth transitions between sections
- [ ] Chapter summary accurate and complete
- [ ] All cross-references verified

## Special Considerations

### Case Studies
- Base on realistic scenarios
- Include actual directory structures
- Show decision-making process
- Include challenges and how they were resolved
- End with concrete lessons learned
- Obtain permission if using real project data

### Templates
- Must be immediately usable
- Include clear instructions
- Provide both blank and filled examples
- Test in real festival scenarios
- Available in multiple formats

### Comparisons
- Be fair and objective
- Acknowledge strengths of other methodologies
- Focus on differences, not superiority
- Provide migration paths
- Use factual comparisons, not opinions

## Collaboration Guidelines

### For Multiple Writers
- Coordinate on terminology and style
- Share examples to avoid duplication
- Review each other's work for consistency
- Maintain a shared glossary
- Communicate about cross-references

### Version Control
- Commit completed sections, not partial work
- Use clear commit messages
- Tag major milestones
- Keep work-in-progress in separate branches

## Festival-Specific Rules

### Book Goals

- Provide immediate, practical value
- Balance theory with application
- Show real-world applicability
- Build reader confidence

### Success Metrics
- Reader can plan their first festival after Chapter 5
