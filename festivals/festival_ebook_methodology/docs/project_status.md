   - Complete competitive analysis

2. **Sequence 2**: Begin writing foundation
   - Draft introduction chapter
   - Finalize chapter template

3. **Sequence 3**: Develop examples
   - Write case studies
   - Create all templates

4. **Sequence 4**: Production
   - Implement design and layout
   - Prepare marketing materials

## Updates Made
- Added specs/ directory following the updated Festival methodology
- Created comprehensive planning documents:
  - Requirements analysis with functional/non-functional requirements
  - Market research with competitive analysis and positioning
  - Content planning with key messages and strategies
- Updated directory naming from 001_ format to simple numbers (1_, 2_, etc.)

## Directory Organization
This festival can use the following optional directories as needed:
- **completed/**: For finished sequences as they're completed
- **canceled/**: For any sequences that get abandoned
- **archived/**: For deprioritized work that might be useful later (backlog)

## Festival Planning Insights
This festival demonstrates:
- How to plan a complex creative project using Festival methodology
- The flexibility to include specs/ and docs/ directories
- Clear sequential dependencies (can't write without planning, can't polish without content)
- Parallel work opportunities within each sequence
- The value of upfront research and planning in the specs/ directory

## Success Metrics
- Clear, actionable tasks for each phase
- Comprehensive coverage of ebook creation process
- Built-in flexibility for discoveries during execution
- Documentation that supports the festival's goal
- Research and planning artifacts preserved in specs/
