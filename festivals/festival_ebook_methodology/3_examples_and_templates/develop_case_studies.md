# Task: Develop Comprehensive Case Studies

## Objective
Create 3-5 detailed case studies showing Festival methodology in action across different scales and contexts.

## Required Case Studies

### 1. Solo Developer: Building a CLI Tool
**Scenario**: Individual developer creating a command-line tool for personal productivity
- **Goal**: Build a task management CLI
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Key Challenges**: Feature creep, maintaining focus
- **Festival Structure**: Simple, 3-sequence approach
- **Lessons Learned**: How festivals prevent scope creep

### 2. Small Team: Launching a New Feature
**Scenario**: 4-person team adding real-time collaboration to existing app
- **Goal**: Implement live editing with conflict resolution
- **Duration**: 6 weeks
- **Key Challenges**: Technical complexity, coordination
- **Festival Structure**: Multiple parallel tasks per sequence
- **Lessons Learned**: Balancing autonomy with coordination

### 3. Enterprise: System Migration
**Scenario**: 20-person team migrating from monolith to microservices
- **Goal**: Decompose monolithic application
- **Duration**: 4 months
