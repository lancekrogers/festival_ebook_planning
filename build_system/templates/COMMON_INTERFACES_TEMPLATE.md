## Interface Definition Status

**Current Status**: [DRAFT | UNDER_REVIEW | FINALIZED]

**Review Deadline**: [Date when interfaces must be finalized]

**Stakeholder Sign-off Required**: [List of roles/people who must approve]

## Step 1: System Architecture Overview

### High-Level System Components

| Component | Responsibility | Technology Stack | Dependencies |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| [Component Name] | [What it does] | [Tech choices] | [What it needs] |
| Frontend Web App | User interface, state management | React, TypeScript | API Gateway, CDN |
| API Gateway | Request routing, authentication | Express.js, JWT | User Service, Product Service |
| User Service | Authentication, user management | Node.js, PostgreSQL | Email Service, Cache |
| Product Service | Catalog, inventory management | Python, MongoDB | Search Service, Image Service |
| Email Service | Transactional emails | SendGrid API | Template Storage |

### System Boundaries and Data Flow

    B --> C[API Gateway]
    C --> D[User Service]
    C --> E[Product Service]

    D --> I[Email Service]
    I --> J[SendGrid API]
    
    K[Mobile App] --> C
    L[Admin Dashboard] --> C
```

### External System Dependencies

| System | Purpose | Protocol | SLA Requirements |
|--------|---------|----------|------------------|
| [System Name] | [What we use it for] | [How we connect] | [Uptime/Performance] |
| SendGrid | Transactional emails | HTTPS/REST | 99.95% uptime, <2s response |
| Stripe | Payment processing | HTTPS/REST | 99.99% uptime, <1s response |
| AWS S3 | File storage | HTTPS/REST | 99.9% uptime, <500ms response |
| Redis Cloud | Session storage | Redis Protocol | 99.99% uptime, <10ms response |

---

## Step 2: Communication Protocol Selection

### Internal Service Communication

**Selected Protocol**: [REST/GraphQL/gRPC/Message Queue/Custom]

**Rationale**: [Why this protocol was chosen for internal communication]

| Service Pair | Protocol | Justification | Fallback Strategy |
|--------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Frontend ↔ API Gateway | REST over HTTPS | Standard web protocol, caching support | N/A - direct dependency |
| API Gateway ↔ User Service | gRPC | High performance, type safety | HTTP/JSON fallback |
| API Gateway ↔ Product Service | REST | Simpler debugging, HTTP caching | N/A |
| User Service → Email Service | Message Queue | Async, retry handling | Direct HTTP call |

### External Integration Protocols

| Integration | Protocol | Authentication | Rate Limits | Error Handling |
|-------------|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| [Service Name] | [Protocol] | [Auth method] | [Limits] | [Strategy] |
| SendGrid | HTTPS/REST | Bearer Token | 600 req/min | Retry with backoff |
| Stripe | HTTPS/REST | Bearer Token | 100 req/sec | Idempotency keys |
| OAuth Provider | OAuth 2.0/OIDC | Client Secret | Provider limits | Graceful degradation |

---

## Step 3: Data Architecture & Schemas

### Core Data Entities

| Entity | Purpose | Primary Storage | Relationships | Access Patterns |
|--------|---------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| [Entity Name] | [What it represents] | [Where stored] | [Connections] | [How accessed] |
| User | Identity and profile | PostgreSQL | 1:N with Orders | By ID, By email |
| Product | Catalog items | MongoDB | M:N with Categories | By ID, Search, Filter |
| Order | Purchase records | PostgreSQL | N:1 with User, M:N with Products | By User, By date range |
| Session | User state | Redis | 1:1 with User | By session token |

### Data Consistency Requirements

| Operation | Consistency Level | Justification | Fallback Strategy |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| [Operation] | [Strong/Eventual/Weak] | [Why] | [What if fails] |
| User Registration | Strong | Critical for auth | Manual cleanup |
| Product Catalog Updates | Eventual | Can tolerate brief inconsistency | Retry mechanism |
| Payment Processing | Strong | Financial accuracy required | Transaction rollback |
| Session Management | Weak | Can recreate if lost | Force re-login |

## Implementation Phase Integration

### Phase 002 Output

This document will be populated during **002_DEFINE_INTERFACES** sequences:

- System architecture understanding (Steps 1-2)
- Protocol and data decisions (Steps 3-4)
- Detailed interface contracts (Steps 5-6)
- Non-functional requirements (Steps 7-8)

### Phase 003 Input

**003_IMPLEMENT** teams use this as their contract specification:

- Build exactly to these interface definitions
- Use tables and diagrams for implementation guidance
- Create mocks based on defined contracts
- Validate against performance and security requirements

### Key Principle

Diagrams and tables provide clear implementation guidance without prescribing specific code. Teams can choose their implementation approach while adhering to the interface contracts defined here.
