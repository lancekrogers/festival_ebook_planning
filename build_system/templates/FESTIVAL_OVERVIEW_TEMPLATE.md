# Festival Overview: [Project Name]

## Project Goal

**Primary Objective**: [ONE clear sentence describing what this festival will accomplish]

**Example**: "Build a secure user authentication system with email/password login, social authentication, and role-based access control for the web application."

## Success Criteria

**The festival is successful when:**

- [ ] **Functional Success**: [Specific functional outcomes achieved]
- [ ] **Quality Success**: [Quality standards met]  
- [ ] **Business Success**: [Business value delivered]
- [ ] **User Success**: [User experience goals met]

**Example Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can register, login, and logout with email/password
- [ ] Google and GitHub social authentication work seamlessly
- [ ] Role-based permissions (user/admin) control access properly
- [ ] All authentication flows pass security audit
- [ ] Page load times remain under 200ms after auth integration
- [ ] 95% of test users complete registration without assistance

## Problem Statement

**Current State**: [What exists today and what problems it creates]

**Desired Future State**: [What we want to achieve and why it matters]

**User Impact**: [How this affects the people who will use the system]

**Business Impact**: [How this affects business goals and operations]

**Example Problem Statement:**
```
Current State: Our web application has no user authentication, so all users see the same content and we can't personalize experiences or restrict access to sensitive features.

Desired Future State: Users can securely create accounts, login with multiple methods, and access personalized content based on their role and preferences.

User Impact: Users get personalized experiences, can save preferences, and trust that their data is secure.

Business Impact: We can gather user analytics, offer premium features, and comply with data privacy requirements.
```

## Scope & Constraints

### In Scope
- [List specific features and functionality to be built]
- [Include technical components and integrations]
- [Specify quality and performance requirements]

### Out of Scope  
- [List what will NOT be included in this festival]
- [Identify future enhancements or separate projects]
- [Clarify boundaries to prevent scope creep]

### Constraints
- **Technical**: [Technology limitations, existing systems, architectural constraints]
- **Timeline**: [Key dates, dependencies, external deadlines]
- **Resources**: [Team size, budget, skill limitations]
- **Business**: [Regulatory requirements, business policy constraints]

**Example Scope:**
```
In Scope:
- Email/password registration and login
- Google OAuth and GitHub OAuth integration
- User roles (regular user, admin) with permission system
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management
- Session management and security

Out of Scope:
- Multi-factor authentication (future enhancement)
- Enterprise SSO integration (separate project)
- Advanced user analytics and reporting
- Mobile app authentication (different project)

Constraints:
- Technical: Must integrate with existing React frontend and Node.js backend
- Timeline: Must complete before Q1 product launch (12 weeks)
- Resources: 2 full-stack developers, 1 designer, part-time QA
- Business: Must comply with GDPR and SOC 2 requirements
```

## Festival Structure Overview

### Phase 001: PLAN
**Objective**: Complete requirements analysis and system architecture planning

**Key Sequences**:
- Requirements analysis and user story definition
- Technical architecture design and database planning
- Security architecture and compliance planning

**Deliverables**: Requirements specification, architecture documentation, technology decisions

### Phase 002: DEFINE_INTERFACES ⭐ CRITICAL PHASE
**Objective**: Define and finalize all system interfaces before implementation begins

**Key Sequences**:
- API contract definition (authentication endpoints, user management APIs)
- Database schema design and relationships
- Frontend component interface specifications
- External service integration contracts (OAuth providers)

**Deliverables**: COMMON_INTERFACES.md with FINALIZED status, stakeholder sign-offs

**Critical Success Factor**: NO Phase 003 work begins until ALL interfaces are FINALIZED

### Phase 003: IMPLEMENT  
**Objective**: Build the authentication system according to finalized interface contracts

**Key Sequences**:
- Backend authentication services implementation
- Frontend authentication UI and state management
- Database implementation and migration scripts
- Integration with external OAuth providers

**Deliverables**: Working authentication system, comprehensive test suite

### Phase 004: REVIEW_AND_UAT
**Objective**: Validate system meets requirements through user acceptance testing

**Key Sequences**:
- User acceptance testing with real users
- Security audit and penetration testing
- Performance testing and optimization
- Stakeholder review and approval

**Deliverables**: Approved system ready for production deployment

## Key Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- [Systems, teams, or resources within organization that this festival depends on]
- [Other projects or initiatives that must complete first]

### External Dependencies  
- [Third-party services, vendors, or external systems required]
- [Regulatory approvals or legal reviews needed]

### Critical Path Items
- [Dependencies that could block or delay the entire festival]
- [High-risk items requiring early attention]

**Example Dependencies:**
```
Internal Dependencies:
- Database infrastructure team must provision PostgreSQL instance
- Security team must complete compliance review of authentication flows
- Design system team must provide authentication UI components

External Dependencies:
- Google OAuth application approval (can take 2-3 weeks)
- GitHub OAuth application setup
- SSL certificate procurement for production environment

Critical Path Items:
- OAuth provider approvals (start immediately, can block testing)
- Security architecture review (required before implementation)
- Database schema finalization (blocks all backend development)
```

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| [Risk Description] | [High/Medium/Low] | [High/Medium/Low] | [How to prevent or respond] |
| OAuth approval delays | Medium | High | Start applications early, have fallback email-only flow |
| Performance impact on existing system | High | Medium | Load testing in Phase 004, performance monitoring |
| Security vulnerabilities discovered | Low | High | Security review in Phase 002, penetration testing |
| Team capacity constraints | Medium | Medium | Cross-training, external consultant backup |
